	bool
	default y
	prompt "Enable elliptic curve support"
	help
		Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key
		cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves
		over finite fields. ECC requires smaller keys compared to non-ECC
		cryptography to provide equivalent security.

	help
		ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD ciphersuite with 256-bit keys,
		combining ChaCha stream cipher with Poly1305 MAC.

	bool
	default n
	prompt "Enable compression support"
	help
		TLS compression is not recommended, as it is deemed insecure.
		The CRIME attack exploits this weakness.
		Even with this option turned on, it is disabled by default, and the
		application must explicitly turn it on.

config OPENSSL_OPTIMIZE_SPEED
	bool
	default y if x86_64 || i386

	select OPENSSL_WITH_ASM
	help
		Enabling this option increases code size (around 20%) and
		performance.  The increase in performance and size depends on the
		target CPU. EC and AES seem to benefit the most, with EC speed
		increased by 20%-50% (mipsel & x86).
		AES-GCM is supposed to be 3x faster on x86. YMMV.

config OPENSSL_WITH_ASM
	bool
	default y
	prompt "Compile with optimized assembly code"
	depends on !arc
	help
		Disabling this option will reduce code size and performance.
		The increase in performance and size depends on the target
		CPU and on the algorithms being optimized.  As of 1.1.0i*:

config OPENSSL_NO_SSE2
	bool
	default y if TARGET_x86_legacy || TARGET_x86_geode
	prompt "Disable use of x86 SSE2 instructions"
	help
		Use of SSE2 instructions greatly increase performance (up to
		3x faster) with a minimum (~0.2%, or 23KB) increase in package
		size, but it will bring no benefit if your hardware does not
		support them, such as Geode GX and LX.  In this case you may
		save 23KB by saying yes here.  AMD Geode NX, and Intel
		Pentium 4 and above support SSE2.
